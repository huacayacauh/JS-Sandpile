# JS-Sandpile

The JS-Sandpiles app is a simple JavaScript implementation of the [Abelian sandpile model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abelian_sandpile_model). The app contains a few tiling presets
such as Square and Hexagonal grids, Penrose tilings P2 P3, and can extend to arbitrary graph (not yet implemented).
